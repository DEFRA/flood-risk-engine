  # We install and run these checks first prior to the data migrations in order
  # 'fail fast'. There is no point in running the migrations if these checks
  # fail.
  # Install and run brakeman. We always go with the latest (unlike rubocop where
  # we include the dependency in the project tied to a version) because we want
  # to check the project against the latest known vulnerabilities.

  # Install and run i18n-tasks.
  - gem install i18n-tasks -v 0.9.6 --no-ri --no-rdoc
  # TO FIX: Running this will report approx 275 missing keys. This is because of
  # the way we have used translations in the project. Initial attempts to use
  # magic comments (see https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks#fine-tuning) has not
  # brought forth a solution so until this matter is investigated further and
  # resolved this check needs to be left out of the build.

  # However we are currently getting error 'Invalid doctype. (doctype-html5)' in
  # app/views/flood_risk_engine/layouts/mail.html.erb. The problem is we have
  # disabled this rule in `.htmlhintrc` but its making no difference. So for now
  # we have to specify each folder in turn.

# This section was added as per https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/code-climate/
# To protect our codeclimate stats rather than adding the Codeclimate API key for this project
# in the open we used this guide https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/ to encryt the
# value. Essentially install travis gem, then run `travis encrypt <my_code_climate_api_key>`
