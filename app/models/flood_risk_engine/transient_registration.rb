    # HasSecureToken provides an easy way to generate unique random tokens for
    # any model in ruby on rails. We use it to uniquely identify an registration
    # by something other than it's db ID, or its reference number. We can then
    # use token instead of ID to identify an registration during the journey. The
    # format makes it sufficiently hard for another user to attempt to 'guess'
    # the token of another registration in order to see its details.
