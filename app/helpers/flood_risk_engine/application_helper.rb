    # This is a bit of a hack - see discussion e.g. here:

    # This isolated engine cannot access helper methods in the parent app, which is fair enough.
    # However if views defined in this engine are displayed inside a layout defined by the parent
    # app, and that layout calls helper methods (eg in ApplicationHelper) which also defined in the
    # parent app, this will result in undefined method errors. To get around having to duplicate
    # those helper methods here in the engine, forward any methods we not defined here to main_app.
